Project Title: Electric Vehicle (EV) Market and Performance Analysis
Overview:
The Electric Vehicle (EV) Market and Performance Analysis project conducts a comprehensive examination of the electric vehicle industry, exploring key market dynamics, technological advancements, and environmental implications. This project leverages data analytics, predictive modeling, and sustainability assessments to evaluate EV adoption, performance metrics, and lifecycle impacts, with a focus on driving factors like Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and Range-Extender Electric Vehicles (REEVs).

Objectives:
Market Analysis:

Market Sizing and Forecasting: Quantify the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for EVs, estimate Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), and generate demand forecasts through regression models and trend analysis.
Market Segmentation: Perform segmentation analysis based on vehicle type, such as BEVs, PHEVs, and commercial EVs. Utilize cluster analysis to identify regional preferences, with an emphasis on emerging markets and established markets (North America, Europe, APAC).
Consumer Adoption:

Consumer Behavioral Analysis: Study the psychographics and demographics of consumers adopting EVs. Examine consumer perceptions, with a focus on range anxiety, charging infrastructure availability, total cost of ownership (TCO), and lifetime value (LTV).
Adoption Curve Modeling: Use Bass Diffusion Models to predict the adoption lifecycle of EVs across different geographies and income brackets.
